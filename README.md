## Overview

"🌐 **Smart Cricket Stadium: Where Tradition Meets Innovation** 🏟️⚙️

Welcome to the dawn of a new era in sports management – introducing the Smart Cricket Stadium project. With a fusion of cutting-edge technology and timeless sporting heritage, we're redefining what a cricket ground can be.

🌦️ **Rain or Shine, Play On:** Our automatic pitch-covering system ensures that rain delays are a thing of the past. Rain sensors detect incoming weather, triggering a seamless cover deployment within seconds.

☀️ **Sun-Powered Brilliance:** Embracing sustainability, our stadium features a solar-covered roof that moves with the sun. This intelligent design optimizes energy capture, powering the stadium while reducing our environmental impact.

🎯 **Precision Beyond Boundaries:** Accurate gameplay starts with precise boundaries. Our automatic boundary line fix system uses advanced technology to maintain boundary integrity, ensuring fairness and integrity in every match.

💡 **Lighting in Tune with Nature:** Day or night, our stadium lighting adapts to the sun's intensity. LDR sensors govern the lighting, creating a perfect balance between the electrifying ambiance of floodlights and the natural glow of sunlight.

👥 **Fair Play, Data-Driven:** Umpires can now make informed decisions, thanks to our player counting system under 30 yards. Accurate player positioning ensures that every run, catch, and wicket is officiated with clarity.

🚀 The Smart Cricket Stadium is more than a field – it's a vision of the future. We're pushing boundaries, challenging norms, and presenting a glimpse into the potential of sports technology.

## Mechanical Process

The mechanical process behind our Smart Cricket Stadium is a synergy of cutting-edge technology and meticulous engineering. At its heart lies the Arduino Uno, orchestrating a symphony of components. The Humidity Detection Sensor and Rain Sensor collaborate seamlessly to detect rain, triggering the deployment of the innovative pitch covering system, powered by the precision of Stepper Motors. The LDR Sensor and Solar Panel form a dynamic duo, tracking the sun's arc and harnessing its energy to power the stadium, while the Servo Motor ensures optimal solar panel alignment. The boundary line fix system, backed by IR and DC Motors, guarantees accuracy, as the Li-ion Battery and meticulously calibrated Resistor networks ensure uninterrupted performance. This intricate ballet of components, connected by Jumper Wires, forms the backbone of our pioneering stadium, where technology meets tradition to redefine sports management.
